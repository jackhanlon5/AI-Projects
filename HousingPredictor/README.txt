XGBoost model using a Kaggle data set which is meant to be deployed on a local host and allow a user to input the information of a house for sale and get the predicted housing value.

Will have a model.py file that shows how I went about creating, training, and downloading the model as well as a server.py file which contains all of the backend for how a user can interact with my pretrained model
